[![No Maintenance Intended](http://unmaintained.tech/badge.svg)](http://unmaintained.tech/)

A multi-threaded [Stockfish](https://github.com/official-stockfish/Stockfish)
that runs in Chrome using [PNaCl](https://www.chromium.org/nativeclient/pnacl).
Also see [stockfish.js](https://github.com/niklasf/stockfish.js) as a fallback.

Unmaintained, since PNaCl is deprecated and will be replaced by [WebAssembly](https://github.com/niklasf/stockfish.wasm).

About 500 KB uncompressed, 400 KB gzipped.
